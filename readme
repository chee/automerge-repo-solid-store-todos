# automerge repo solid.js todo list app fgr

while building littlebook i had a few ideas i wanted to try out, so i've created
this example app to explore them.

a fine-grained reactive handle can be found in
[./src/use-automerge/use-document.ts].

code just for illustrative purposes of how fun it is to take these precision
updates from one browser, over the wire into another, and have that apply a
precision dom update in another.
